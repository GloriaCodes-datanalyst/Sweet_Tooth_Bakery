## Sweet Tooth Bakery 2025 🍰

This project is a mock analysis of 2024 cake sales from a fictional bakery business.  
I used **Excel** to clean, analyze, and visualize the data — focusing on cake performance, profitability, and the impact of discounts.

## 🔍 Project Overview

**Goal:**  
To explore which cakes contributed the most to revenue and profit, and whether discounts helped or hurt overall performance.

**Key Questions:**
- Which cakes were the top sellers?
- Which cakes were the most profitable?
- How did discounts affect sales and profit?

## 📊 What I Did in Excel

- Cleaned and explored raw sales data
- Used pivot tables and formulas (e.g., SUMIFS, IF, % profit margin)
- Built an interactive dashboard showing:
  - Top 5 cakes by total sales
  - Profit vs. production cost per cake
  - Impact of discounts on revenue and profit

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

- **Sales ≠ Profit:** High sales don’t always mean high profitability — especially when discounts are involved.
- **Discounts need strategy:** Discounts increased sales for some cakes but reduced overall profit for others.
- **Storytelling matters:** A clear dashboard helps communicate insights even to non-technical audiences.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Recreate the analysis using **SQL** to practice querying large datasets
- Visualize insights using **Tableau** to improve my data storytelling skills
- Share more projects to grow my portfolio and connect with the data community
